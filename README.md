### Lab 2

In this lab we are asked to convert prefix notation to postfix notation, with recursion.

In doing so, we create a stack using a List. We iterate through the input expression. First check whether the given
prefix location at index i is an operator or not. When an operator exists we check that two operands exist or not. If so,
we properly pop and add to an auxiliary variable that is then pushed into our stack. If not, we then set the is_valid
to False. When we get valid operands we push to our stack. If we find something incorrect we raise an error / exception.

In this case we do not raise an exception as we want the program to continue with the entire input. We have several options
on how to go about this, but find returning a string as an error and popping the stack will allow us to iterate over the
entire input file and return the results as a dictionary to the end-user.

We have also created a container in a Dockerfile to run the program. We expect that containers will be used via Kubernetes
or another tool like airflow to run the program continuously. 

Thanks Jordan!
